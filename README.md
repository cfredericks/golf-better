# TODO

- Move all infra to repo in spirit of IaC (i.e. CloudSQL, service accounts, CRON scheduler, GSM secrets, etc.)
- Improve data model and JSON processing to use our own model, rather than a jsonb column with the original API response
  - And rethink the data model in terms of which tables/objects we need now that we have a DB
- Make app prettier and more usable for navigating Leaderboards
- Improve the CRON scheduler for leaderboards so it is more efficient with live events
- Add page for creating and tracking bets, along with necessary app engine methods and DB tables
- Add user management (Google account)
-
